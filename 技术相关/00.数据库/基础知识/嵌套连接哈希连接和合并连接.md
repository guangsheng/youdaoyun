#### nested loop join（嵌套连接）
根据左表查询到的行作为游标查询的条件一次输出查询结果（适合游标的关联列发生在唯一索引上的场景）。  

The right relation is scanned once for every row found in the left relation.This strategy is easy to implement but can be very time consuming.(However,if the right relation can be scanned with an index scan,this can be a good strategy. It is possible to user values from the current row of the left relation as keys for the index scan of the right).

#### hash join（哈希连接）
首先右表扫描加载到HASH表中，hash key为JOIN列。然后左表扫描，并与内存中的hash表进行关联，输出最终结果。  

The right relation is first scanned and loaded into a hash table, using its join attributes as hash keys. Next the left relation is scanned and the appropriate values of every row found are used as hash keys to locate the matching rows in the table. 

#### merge join（合并连接）
首先两个JOIN的表根据join key进行排序。然后根据join key的排序顺序并行扫描两个表进行匹配输出最终结果。这种方式适合大表并且索引列进行关联的情况。  

Each relation is sorted on the join attributes before the join starts.Then the two relations are scanned in parallel, and matching rows are combined to form join rows.The kind of join is more attractive because each relation has to be scanned only once.The requeired sorting might be achieved either by an explicit sort setp, or by scanning the relation in the proper order useing an index on the join key.
