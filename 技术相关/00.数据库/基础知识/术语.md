#### TPC-C
TPC-C is an On-Line Transaction Processing Benchmark  
Approved in July of 1992, TPC Benchmark C is an on-line transaction processing (OLTP) benchmark. TPC-C is more complex than previous OLTP benchmarks such as TPC-A because of its multiple transaction types, more complex database and overall execution structure. TPC-C involves a mix of five concurrent transactions of different types and complexity either executed on-line or queued for deferred execution. The database is comprised of nine types of tables with a wide range of record and population sizes. TPC-C is measured in transactions per minute (tpmC). While the benchmark portrays the activity of a wholesale supplier, TPC-C is not limited to the activity of any particular business segment, but, rather represents any industry that must manage, sell, or distribute a product or service.

TPC-C测试用到的模型是一个大型的商品批发销售公司，它拥有若干个分布在不同区域的商品仓库。当业务扩展的时候，公司将添加新的仓库。每个仓库负责为10个销售点供货，其中每个销售点为3000个客户提供服务，每个客户提交的订单中，平均每个订单有10项产品，所有订单中约1%的产品在其直接所属的仓库中没有存货，必须由其他区域的仓库来供货。同时，每个仓库都要维护公司销售的100000种商品的库存记录。
